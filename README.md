# âš¡ EcoGridAI: Hybrid LSTM-Based Renewable Energy Forecasting and Grid Optimisation for Sustainable Power Management

---

## ðŸ“– Overview
EcoGridAI is a research-driven project focusing on **renewable energy forecasting and grid optimization** using hybrid **Deep Learning** (LSTM, CNN-LSTM) and **Machine Learning** (XGBoost, Random Forest) models.  
The project integrates **weather data** with **energy market data** to forecast renewable energy trends, optimize grid balancing, and simulate risk levels.  

This repository forms part of my MSc Thesis in Data Science.
